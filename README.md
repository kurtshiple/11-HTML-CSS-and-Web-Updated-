# HTML-CSS-and-Web-for-Weather-Data

The purpose of this project was to create a visualization dashboard website that would display weather data. In building this dashboard, individual pages will be created for each plot as well as a means by which one could navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. It will also have a landing page, a page where one can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where one can view the data used to build them.

It will include 7 total pages:

A landing page containing:


An explanation of the project.
Links to each visualizations page.


Four visualization pages, each with:


A descriptive title and heading tag.
The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.


A "Comparisons" page that:


Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so one could easily visually compare them.

A "Data" page that:


Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
The table is a bootstrap table component.
The data comes from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML. 

The website will also have a navigation menu with a dropdown.
